## üîß Configuration Required

Before running the application, ensure you have:

1. **MongoDB**: Local installation or MongoDB Atlas account
2. **OpenAI API Key**: Get from https://platform.openai.com
3. **AWS Account**:
   - Create S3 bucket
   - Configure IAM user with S3 permissions
   - Get access key and secret
4. **Environment Variables**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in values

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Configure environment: Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update values
3. Run development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open browser: http://localhost:3000

## üìù Notes

- Text extraction is limited to 10,000 characters to avoid token limits
- AI processing happens asynchronously after file upload
- Documents have status tracking (processing, completed, failed)
- Admin users are automatically assigned based on ADMIN_EMAIL in env
- JWT tokens expire after 7 days
- S3 signed URLs expire after 7 days

## üêõ Potential Issues & Solutions

1. **MongoDB Connection Error**

   - Ensure MongoDB is running locally or Atlas connection string is correct
   - Check network connectivity

2. **OpenAI API Errors**

   - Verify API key is correct and has credits
   - Check rate limits

3. **AWS S3 Upload Failures**

   - Verify bucket name matches configuration
   - Check IAM permissions
   - Ensure CORS is configured if needed

4. **File Upload Errors**

   - Check file size limits (default 10MB in Next.js config)
   - Verify file type is PDF or DOCX

5. **TypeScript Errors**
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all type definitions are installed
   - Check that all dependencies match package.json versions

## üìö Next Steps for Production

1. Set up proper error logging (e.g., Sentry)
2. Implement rate limiting for API routes
3. Add unit and integration tests
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline
5. Configure production environment variables
6. Set up monitoring and analytics
7. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
8. Add file size limits and validation
9. Implement file cleanup for old documents
10. Add email notifications for processing completion
